What mess this leads to Your co-workers like this shiny new tool and also start to employ it, and pretty soon someone collects in a header what you all have come up with so far. Here's ours: Assignment, at its heart, is two steps: tearing down the object's old state and building its new state as a copy of some other object's state. In C++, this is often done using function objects (also called functors). These are objects that overload the function call operator, so you can call them as if they were a function. Example: From [dcl.fct], pretty explicitly: Just to update this question for C++11, this is now both possible to do and very natural: The following program compiles with both gcc and clang, but is this actually standard C++11 or do both compilers choose to support it for convenience? This example consists of multiple files: The last bullet point there gives us a difference. Consider: Instead, you can either fold over a comma: Yes, there is such a case where the two will not behave the same. At the time the C++ standard didn't have a special term for this, which was an oversight in C++11 and makes it hard to teach. This oversight was remedied by N4164, which added the following definition to [temp.deduct]: I want to write some function that takes a string literal - and only a string literal: Unless both pointers point to elements of the same array object, or one past the last element of the array object, the behavior is undefined.\n",

      "There's not really anything outsiders can do to get around \"I am not allowed to do that.\" There have been other questions about this topic, both on here and on Programmer's Stack Exchange. Suffice to say, quality is important for later maintenance of code but value cannot be sacrificed completely in order to achieve it. Here's an interesting viewpoint on this topic. However, it's looking like your company does not really do Scrum. The commonly accepted word for what you're doing is Scrumbut. So your two options are: Yes and no. Since the 'team leader' is a member of the Team, his opinion should be taken into account. If any team member's opinion is ignored during organization, then that's a strong smell that there's something wrong with the whole 'self-organizing' situation. One thing you and he need to take into consideration, however, is that Scrum recognizes no 'team lead' role. The only roles in the Scrum Team are Product Owner, Development Team Member, and Scrum Master. No member of the Development Team intrinsically has more decision-making authority than any other member. The 'team lead' does not own the issue. However, neither does the person working on it. The entire Team owns each issue (once they've entered into the Sprint), and as such any complications or concerns regarding implementation details of those issues are the purview of the entire Team. When something like this comes up, the details need to be discussed (note: not during the daily Scrum, that's not the purpose of that meeting) and a consensus needs to be reached. If the 'team lead' believes there is a problem with how someone else is approaching an issue, then what he should be doing is explaining the problem and convincing everyone that his approach will be better - not simply dictating how it should be done and assuming his orders will be followed. Likewise, this can and should be done when any Team member sees a problem with an issue being worked on by any other Team member. It's not just the 'team lead' who should do this. If, for whatever reason, you do need day-to-day updates of when initial, non-accepted development work on stories is done, then I would suggest using a separate chart. Don't throw away the burndown, though. Keep it for completed stories and velocity planning. Ask your company how they intend to implement their particular version of Pretends-To-Be-Scrum-But-Actually-Is-Not-Even-Agile. Because we, not being part of your company, cannot really answer that question for you. Keep in mind that it's possible there might not be anything actually wrong with what your company is doing, from a business-perspective... but calling it Scrum is blatantly false. As the Scrum Guide notes: Two things wrong here. First, estimates should be done in terms of relative effort (story points), not time. Second, instead of estimating in x-points-for-y-developers, just estimate for x-points. Otherwise, you are locking yourself into how many developers will work on the Epic, which is distinctly un-Agile. If you're just looking for a way to determine likelihood of reaching a Sprint's Goal, can't you just look at the sprint board? Assuming you have sufficient columns ('waiting for install/deploy' comes to mind, in your case), it should provide a decent overview of the sprint. If you're halfway through the sprint and 80% of your stories are still in 'TODO' or 'In Progress', then you've got a problem, etc. While it's not a precision metric, it should suffice in most cases. Try to convince your company to switch to actual Scrum. If the reasoning behind this particular version of Scrumbut was something along the lines of: \"This Scrum thing looks nice, but we probably don't need this, and this, and this...\" then take a look at We Tried Baseball and It Didn't Work. The main (not necessarily sole, depending on who you ask) goal of the Team is to provide value to the customer. What would solve your problem is integrating slack time into your estimates. You under-commit, with the now-extra time being made into slack time. Whenever things go smoothly, the slack time is used for non-scheduled, side-tasks. Researching. Spikes. Cleaning Technical Debt. Writing that documentation everyone keeps forgetting about. Any number of things. Eventually, your users will simply stop attempting to bring requests directly to the developers, and will bring them through the Product Owner instead. This isn't to say that developers should never be contacted by users. Face-to-face is among the best ways to gather feedback. However, nothing should ever be worked on until the work has been made visible and prioritized (the latter of which only the Product Owner is authorized to do). And when things don't go smoothly and you have these \"environments instability\" problems crop up, you spend your slack time fixing them. No slack (or less slack) that sprint, but you still get done what you actually committed to. What is the reason for this? Are the projects highly related? Are they just so small that doing only a single project per sprint is infeasible? If the Development Team is working on a multitude of unrelated tasks during a sprint, you may want to consider an approach other than Scrum, such as Kanban.\n",

      "In my opinion, the advantage in brake modulation and power, not to mention consistency in all weather conditions far outweighs the the addition of a few grams. No pun intended. The difference is usually in the length of the threaded insert that goes in the frame, and that the caliper bolt threads into. The inserts are available separately, and must be sized correctly for the frame. There may be some older calipers where the bolt itself is too long, but a Ti/Carbon frame sounds pretty new for that. The Ultegra 6600 STI lever is available as a right hand only part. It should cost around $400 dollars for the right shifter only, and around $600 dollars for the set. ____________ 16mm _____________________________________________________ 22mm _________________________ The compatibility chart can be found here. They come in 16mm and 22mm lengths. A steel frame would normally use the shorter 16mm version. See photos. The photo below is a pre-release Shimano Hyddraulic STI lever seen last February on Rabobank pro rider Michiel vd Heijden's cyclocross bike. The Magura RT6 and RT8 Hydraulic TT brakes have been available (if somewhat unusual) since last year. They are a solid system which is compatible with most current TT frames. The RT6I've only seen as an OEM product. The RT8 seems to be the retail version. The weight comparison only becomes truly significant when you look at more basic bicycles, i.e. the $600-1500 market, because the cost penalties for premium parts, like truly light weight disc brakes and hubs, don't allow use in that market. Any loss of grip between the rear pads and rim, or any mechanical failure of the rear brake, will keep the front brake from operating, rendering the bike brakeless. In other words, the system eliminates one of the key safety features of other bikes with two brakes: redundancy in case of mechanical issues, especially in emergency braking situations where cable systems in particular are stressed the most. The design differences with modern pads are obvious. You get a huge simple block of rubber with no grooves. Nothing about the design of the pad is coaxing you to replace it any time before the metal part starts contacting the rim, a point that most riders will be able to see coming and all but the least observant will hear about the second it starts actually happening, before any serious damage is done. The simple option is to \"burp\" a little fluid out by removing and putting aside the pads, putting a rag up to the caliper bleed port, slightly opening the port, and resetting the pistons with the port open (again cleaning/lubricating the pistons first as needed). Some fluid will come out, which the rag is there to soak up before it makes a mess. Close the bleed port quickly when you're done of course. This usually works fine for all intents and purposes. You are reducing the boiling point of the brake fluid every time you do this as well as increasing its compressibility, both of which could hypothetically make some kind of meaningful difference at some point, but we're really talking about a very small amount of water. You also shouldn't try this if you're not prepared to bleed the brake in case something goes wrong. I'll add the disclaimer that I haven't actually done this on Clark's brakes, only on many, many Avid/SRAM brakes. Wear gloves and eye protection. The difference is usually in the length of the threaded insert that goes in the frame, and that the caliper bolt threads into. If you are looking at an aftermarket upgrade, expect to spend $1500 on new wheels and brakes, and often more, for quality, lightweight kit. The weight penalty has gotten down to only 50-100 grams in most cases, between a bike built with a high quality disc setup and a high quality V-brake setup. The weight comparison only becomes truly significant when you look at more basic bicycles, i.e. the $600-1500 market, because the cost penalties for premium parts, like truly light weight disc brakes and hubs, don't allow use in that market. In my opinion, the advantage in brake modulation and power, not to mention consistency in all weather conditions far outweighs the the addition of a few grams. No pun intended. The difference in weight is there, but hasn't really been significant for the last few years. Scott, for instance, is building a complete, disc brake hardtail with a 4\" travel fork. Bike weight: 7.45 Kg, or roughly 16 lbs. That's 2 lbs less than my road bike. A theoretical advantage of this kind of system is for one-handed users, especially if the one braking hand available has compromised strength. Unlike split levers, they don't have the drawback that they're dividing one hand's braking force between two different brakes, since they're making use of otherwise-wasted energy to actuate the front brake. IS has one clear upside: all the threads are in a relatively cheap and easy to replace adapter. The disadvantages are that it's more mechanically complex and expensive since there's always an adapter, and the design of the standard is such that the same adapter doesn't adapt the same caliper to the same rotor size front and rear. A adapter for 180mm in the front is an adapter for 160 used in the rear, for example. Another approach is using one of the generator light brackets available that are somewhat intended to address issues like this by only adding a bare minimum of material behind the caliper. (Maybe you've already looked at this; I offer it in case you're running into the issue by trying to use one of the chunkier generator light brackets out there, such as the plastic ones.) An example would be the B&M 471F:\n",

      "\n",
      "This can result in small sizes having a harsher ride than the median, and large sizes having a softer feel, and slightly less power transfer. This is accentuated by the fact that most riders on a small frame have less weight and mass with which to flex the frame, and larger riders have more. The difference is usually in the length of the threaded insert that goes in the frame, and that the caliper bolt threads into. The Park Tool link provided by Daniel R. Hicks is an excellent resource for learning more detailed concepts about torque, as it relates to bicycles, and finding the exact values for a particular part.

      "Edit- Per request a short, short synopsis. First off, Steve Bockman has an eBook on Amazon that goes into how to do Team Estimation. My exercise is an evolution of Steve's. When you are done, you have all the stories pointed in relation to the other stories. Round 1: Stack of Fruit You start with a stack of cards. For the exercise, it's about ten cards with the name of a fruit on it. The team stands around a table and hand the stack of cards from person to person. Each person can do one of two actions, either place a card on the table, indicating if it is more or less effort than an existing card or they may move a card already on the table. When you are done you have a single row of cards from least effort to most effort (You can do this with business value as well). Round 2: Assign Points At this point you can break out the Fibonacci cards. The lowest effort fruit card has the 1pt card put over it. From here each person takes the next numbered card and places it down using the guidance of \"Is this fruit card roughly 1.5 more effort to prepare and consume than the fruit card to the left.\" Epics are not estimated. They are far too large and nebulous to estimate accurately, so attempting to do so does nothing but give a false sense of schedule-security. There are so very many things wrong with that statement, from a Scrum perspective. I'll go through them in order. Sure; the example you give, while not ideal (particularly the part where the timeline is decided by management, rather than the team), is not impossible to work in. Nor is it that uncommon, unfortunately. The answer depends on whether or not you are actually doing Scrum. If you are, then the answer is during the Sprint Planning Meeting (or, as some Teams do, during the Pre-Planning Meeting). Most methodologies should still work, you just have to frame your thinking differently. For instance, instead of determining whether or not you need to extend your deadline (which in this case is possible), you can determine whether or not you need to strip out some of the features. However, it's looking like your company does not really do Scrum. The commonly accepted word for what you're doing is Scrumbut. So your two options are: Now, to answer your actual question, Ask your company how they intend to implement their particular version of Pretends-To-Be-Scrum-But-Actually-Is-Not-Even-Agile. Because we, not being part of your company, cannot really answer that question for you. Keep in mind that it's possible there might not be anything actually wrong with what your company is doing, from a business-perspective... but calling it Scrum is blatantly false. As the Scrum Guide notes: Most technical initiatives are done for this reason; to provide the business with options to change in the future. Some of them have more direct business concerns which are more easily phrased, like increasing current system performance to cope with growing demand. Others may be relevant to different parts of the business - changing from Fortran to Python to attract better talent and make it easier to recruit - but in the long run, that's still about having options in the future. If the team feel pressured to churn out new features, though, they'll very quickly abandon the technical debt. It can't be seen or measured easily, and as such is usually the first victim of any pressure. In my experience, the pretence that stories should be focused on users tends to result in other stakeholders' needs being pushed back, or treated only as \"Technical Stories\" which then have to be delivered alongside others as 2nd class citizens. They're not user stories. Users are just one type of stakeholder. If you do that, it doesn't matter what you call them. But I'd prefer it not to involve the term \"user\" unless it really means it. Nobody who's interested in those kind of reports is interested in the fine detail. If you've already got stories, you can map the stories to the capabilities / outcomes and come up with them that way (search for \"Story Mapping\"). Thinking about the business impact and the real stakeholders who need to give feedback can really help to address project risk. In this place I agree with @jmort253. It's even better if you can avoid falling into debt in the first place, but usually there are different skill sets on a team, people learning to code well, etc. - so having the ability to refactor as you go and help educate other developers is more important than getting it right up-front.\n",

      "Beat 3: This is really the beginning of a longer beat rather than a whole beat, you can easily find the whole text if you want to examine this practice further. In the next sequence Macbeth and Lady Macbeth engage in a protracted examination of the act of murder, its commission, its possible consequences. The two dance around each other each on their own track. Shakespeare uses this time to convert the characters from what they were before this moment to what they become for the rest of the play. Lady Macbeth in this moment changes from the cold and calculating ice queen whose husband was never good enough into the terrified animal who will eventually snuff out her own life rather than live with the voices that attack her in the darkness. Macbeth goes from the loyal and humble warrior who fights for king and country to power-thirsty dictator with regard for nothing but his own ambition. The mood of this section as it unwinds is a kind of antiseptic stillness, the calm after a hideous storm and the fragmented dialogue pushes the audience into a distant position where they may better regard these two hideous creatures revelling in their own filthy act. \n",

      "Thriller: When a thriller employs multiple viewpoints it tends to have an epic/history-in-the-making/ripped-from-the-headlines feel. It seeks to dwarf individual participants in the circumstances that surround them. The more traditional thriller takes a much more limited point of view, in a pulpy environment it may even slide into first-person for the reason that the protagonist in a thriller where they are the centre of attention is often, on some level, \"the patsy\" i.e. Jason Bourne is very much the CIA's patsy in that series. Limiting the POV in this kind of thriller allows for the setup and execution of tortuous pot-boiler twists that the audience of such fiction loves. \n",
